## How to contribute

* Before you open a ticket or send a pull request, [search](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/issues) for previous discussions about the same feature. Add to the earlier ticket if you find one.

* Before sending a pull request for a feature, add [tests](http://underscorejs.org/test/test.html).

* Use the same coding style as the rest of the [codebase](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore/blob/master/underscore.js).

* Do not add documentation or re-build the minified version. We do those things before cutting a new release.
